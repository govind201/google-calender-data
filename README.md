# Google Calendar Integration App
This app demonstrates how to integrate with Google Calendar using the Google API Client Library for JavaScript (googleapis) and OAuth2 for authentication.

## Requirements
Node.js
A Google API Console project with the Google Calendar API enabled
A client ID and client secret for your project
A redirect URI for your app
## Getting Started
Clone or download the repository.
Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
Rename .env.example to .env and replace the placeholder values with your own client ID, client secret, and redirect URI.
Start the app with npm start.
Visit http://localhost:3000/rest/v1/calendar/init in your web browser to start the OAuth2 flow.
Follow the prompts to grant access to your Google Calendar.
The app will redirect to http://localhost:3000/rest/v1/calendar/redirect with an authorization code. The app will then use the authorization code to get the access token and retrieve a list of events from your Google Calendar.
The list of events will be displayed in the browser.
## Code Explanation
The code for the app is organized into two main parts: the views and the helper functions.

## Views
/rest/v1/calendar/init (GoogleCalendarInitView): This view starts the OAuth2 flow by redirecting the user to the authorization URL.
/rest/v1/calendar/redirect (GoogleCalendarRedirectView): This view handles the redirect from Google with the authorization code. The view uses the authorization code to get the access token and retrieve a list of events from the user's Google Calendar.
# Conclusion
This app demonstrates how to use the googleapis library to implement Google Calendar integration using OAuth2 for authentication. By using this app as a starting point, you can build your own app that integrates with Google Calendar in a secure and reliable way.
